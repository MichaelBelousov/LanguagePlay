# LanguagePlay

### mostly ~~fantasy~~ source of hypothetical programming languages


# Fluster

A programming language that attempts to learn from C++, Python,
and Typescript, while being its own, with a practically non-existent
Lex+Bison+LLVM compiler.

Focusing on refining C language style, making some language concepts simpler
and more uniform, and adding a new powerful concept for infinite abstraction, transformers.

Also hopefully static introspection, for custom constraints and strange
abstractions (imagine a container that strips fields from objects).

See [the sub-README](Fluster/README.md).

# Sizr

A pattern matching language (ala regex) for querying abstract syntax and some semantics
language-agnostically. The goal here is to define source transformations tersely in the
way regular expressions are used.

See [the sub-README](Sizr/README.md).
