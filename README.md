# Fluster

A programming language that attempts to learn from C++, Python,
and Typescript, while being its own, with a practically non-existent
Lex+Bison+LLVM compiler. See [the sub-README](Fluster/README.md).

Hopefully minimal but dense in core features, with a focus on
uniformity and infinite abstraction.
