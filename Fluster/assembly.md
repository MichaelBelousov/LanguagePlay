# Assembly

### inline intermediate code

```C

assembly mylabel
    mov $1, $2
    call label  //this brings up a question on how to add labels...

```

assembly scopes could have custom syntax and be callable as functions
which is equivalent to jumping to the start of that instruction set

perhaps even labels in the assembly can enter the outer scope as functions
